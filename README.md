# LCD-interfacing-using-PIC-Microcontroller
Interfacing a 16 pin LCD screen using PIC microcontroller to demonstrate its use in various applications like Bill Printers, number displayers etc. 
PIC18F4550 microcontroller is used for the project. MPLAB software and pickit 3 are used to burn the code into the microcontroller. 
PIC flashes the sentences "MPMC Project" "LCD_interfacing" "Presented by" "Giri_Adithya" with a specific time delay that was setup in the code. 


An LCD TV monitor utilizes the sunglasses concept to operate its colored pixels. 
On the flip side of the LCD screen, there is a huge bright light that shines out in the direction of the observer. On the front side of the display, it includes the millions of pixels, where each pixel can be made up of smaller regions known as sub-pixels. These are colored with different colors like green, blue, and red. Each
pixel in the display includes a polarizing glass filter at the backside and the front side includes at 90 degrees, so the pixel looks dark normally.
A small twisted nematic liquid crystal is there among the two filters which control electronically. Once it is turned OFF, then it turns the light to pass through 90 degrees, efficiently letting light to supply throughout the two polarizing filters so that pixel seems bright. Once it is activated then it doesnâ€™t turn the light because it is blocked through the polarizer & the pixel seems dark. Every pixel can be controlled through a separate transistor by turning ON and OFF several times
every second.
